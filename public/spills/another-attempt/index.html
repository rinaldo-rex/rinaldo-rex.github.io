    <h1>Another blogging attempt!</h1>
    <h3 id="yaba-yet-another-blogging-attempt">YABA: Yet Another Blogging Attempt</h3>
<h5 id="don-t-give-up">Don't Give up!</h5>
<p>People will shout all kinds of things. What do they know? It's hard. But there's much to words than meets the eye, of course. I should know - I write. A lot - Code, fiction, non-fiction. </p>
<p>I've been trying to maintain a blog of my own for a while now. It's hard for vareity of reasons. (People like giving excuses don't they?! ðŸ¤£) So here's my not-so-genuine excuse: Analysis Paralysis. There's plenty of options to create your own blog these days, and it's just overwhelming. I've been trying to maintain one since the early days of <em>blogging</em> (Indeed, I've had by early blogs in Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, Knol (Now, I'm sure not even many will know this!) but let's leave the past to it!)</p>
<p>And along the many years I've attempted to have a personal blog of my own, I've learnt that life get's busy and we move onto other things. We evolve. In fact faster than ever before thanks to the technological advancements of the modern era. </p>
<p>So the simplest way I could attempt something that doesn't require much work? Static Site Generators. (Spoiler alert: I was wrong) And I've been trying to choose one of the many, many SSGs lately and it's been <em>exhausting!</em> </p>
<p>Don't believe any new SSGs when they say it's easy to create and maintain your site on SSGs because it's not.</p>
<p>I'm a python heavy blogger and naturally, I tried the many offerings on Python. Frankly, I thought I could directly start using Pelican(narrowed down on it because we can directly, easily embed jupyter notebooks in it)
And even had one. It wasn't easy because I kept forgetting the configurations and it was difficult to replicate elsewhere properly.</p>
<p>Recently, I've been trying to learn other (not-so) modern languages. Rust especially. And that's how I came across zola. And I should admit, it was easy to understand, set-up and even remember the configurations (because there isn't as many). Simple, to the point. </p>
<p>Moreover, instead of just thinking about having one, it's better to have one and then move onto others. It's time. </p>
