# Foreword

**[In progress]**

## Welcome.

If you're new here, you should probably know a couple of things. 

Yes, this is a **_book_**. An evolving one, if you will. 
You can view the CHANGELOG in the appendix to get the posts by day/month/year. You'll see the evolution of the book chronologically.

If you're still here, or already have been here, continue. You might find at least something useful somewhere along the pages. From the unwritten words. Between the pages. And I am genuinely happy about the fact that you wanted to check out this book. ðŸ¥° My [email's](mailto:rinaldorexg@gmail.com) always open if you wanna chat. 

### About the author

I'm *Rinaldo* and I'm... 

*thinks\*

Hey, I don't _really_ know _what_ I am. Philosophically speaking, at least. But of course, nobody does (_but wouldn't care to admit, mostly_)

I'm trying to be a better human, developer, and writer. So that's what you'll probably read about throughout.
