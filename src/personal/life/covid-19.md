#### An engineer's cry
Being a developer in a country like India has it's own set of idiosyncracies that when said out loud will only make developers from a well-developed nation frown. We have our stereotypical stature among the western world where everything is looked from the silicon valley perspective. But ofcourse, memes crop up everywhere about Indian developers creating tutorial videos all over the place in this technological landscape.

For the millenial generation of people in India, it's one of the two options when growing up and choosing our studies: An Engineer or a Doctor. 

Now, being an engineer myself, there's nothing wrong about the fact that our previous generation thought about the fact only being an engineer or a doctor is respectable enough in a country that takes the caste system very seriously. (A topic for another day). Their intentions were, for the greater part, genuine, just not morally right perhaps. 

> _After all, being genuine has nothing to do with being morally right!_

It's the clichéd rat race over here. Whether people admit to the involuntary race or not, they sure are a participant. We all are. We all fight over the tiniest of things. Any college graduate, a millenial is going to be an engineer (or a doctor) or be part of this race. This technological landscape in India is nothing new. It's been going on for years now. And very few are even aware of the impact it is causing. Enterprises are scooping up young people from colleges, train them (Or in a better term - drain them (off their creative, and curious juices)) and have them part of the race. 

Of course, This isn't about this race - It's about the pandemic. But what good is talking about the pandemic if you don't know how the lives of the greater part of the nation that is unknowingly playing the part of the pandemic that's infact really worse the Covid-19 situation? 

### A normal day, that really wasn't as normal as was intended to be.

Alright, I'll break this widespread faćade right in the start. No, the majority of people who're active on the social media *all the time* aren't the majority of the nation. [Association fallacy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Association_fallacy) Or even the world, if I may take a bit of a liberty to speak for the world. All things considered, we are all in the same situation. The larger part of the world is run by people who are in fact in pursual of things that they are immediately affected about. Those that run the world (sorry conspiracists) are people just like you and I. We're just normal people going on about our daily lives. Fortunately, some of us very interestingly pursuing things that we are good at. And most of us are good at handling things the way they are - perhaps not inventing or disovering something groundbreaking, but rather just surviving and ensuring the already existing systems, standards, and ways of our living are not broken about. 

I'm repeating that again - It's people like you and I. Who go on about our lives just like every other day, exploring our existing daily works. Perhaps pondering into the purpose of existence, but mostly just going on about the things that work and figuring out why some things don't. For me, it was rather a busy day. I was entrenched in work that day prior to knowing about the national curfew for a day. A test run. I did not have the time to wade through the stupidities of the news/media to come to a sane, unbiased conclusion about what was ensuing in the coming days: A nation-wide lockdown. The biggest, second(?) mostly populated democracy (3)[] in the world was about to go into a complete lockdown.
