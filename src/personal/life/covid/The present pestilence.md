Alright, I'll break this widespread faÄ‡ade right here. No, the majority of people who're active on the social media *all the time* aren't the majority of the nation. [Association fallacy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Association_fallacy) Or even the world, if I may take a bit of a liberty to speak for the world. All things considered, we are all in the same situation. The larger part of the world is run by people who are in fact in pursual of things that they are immediately affected. Those that run the world (sorry conspiracists) are people just like you and I. We're just normal people going on about our daily lives. Fortunately, some of us very interestingly pursuing things that we are good at. And most of us are good at handling things the way they are - perhaps not inventing or discovering something groundbreaking, but rather just surviving and ensuring the already existing systems, standards, and ways of our living are not broken about. 

I'm repeating that - It's people like you and I. Who go on about our lives just like every other day, exploring our existing daily works. Perhaps pondering into the purpose of existence, but mostly just going on about the things that work and figuring out why some things don't.
