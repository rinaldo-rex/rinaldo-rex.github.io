# On Covid - 19

### The global pandemic of the 2019-2020

<div style="text-align:justify">

##### Note before
For those who know me, it's pretty straightforward - I'm a human, an engineer, and a millenial trying to be rational and logical about anything that I come across. 

And for those who don't know me - I'm a human, an engineer, and a millenial trying to be rational and logical about anything that I come across. 

This is to say, I, like most people, extrapolate([1](covid-19.md#1-this-is-to-say-im-no-epidemiologist)) a lot of information about what's going on because of how clouded the media is and how difficult the scientific community is in trying to reach the public. 

And here's my take on the global pandemic of our lifetime. *The coronavirus outbreak.*

<!-- I'm a software engineer (A web developer working exclusively on the backend and AI) and like most people are today, I'm currently in the work from home mode. Unfortunately, it's not the same as a remote work that I have already had the fortune to work with. Neither is this work from home situation similar to how a typical work from home situation should be, so let's set it straight - __We're working amidst the lockdown/Quarantine from home, and not working from home.__ -->

#### On pandemics

Here are some facts that we can't deny or dismiss. 

- This isn't the first global pandemic we're facing.
- This isn't the first of the coronavirus strain we've encountered.
- We know of viable, solid ways in which can keep a pandemic in check.
- We have the technological, medical knowledge to *tackle* a pandemic situation.
- We **do not have** enough equipments, or hospitals to handle a pandemic. Or even a large scale peaks of even known diseases in many countries. 
- Most of the population still doesn't completely understand the severity of the current situation - medically, economically, geographically, politically, and psychopolitically. 
- We're *capable*(technologically, financially, scientifically) of handling a pandemic.
- We're still figuring out in getting hold of the situation without thw worst casualities the history of mankind has ever seen. 

But the most important of all, 
- **We *seriously* underestimate how ignorant we are.**  
   

What I hope to ponder upon, are the above, elaborated.
<!-- ### Life amidst the pandemic

I'm a software engineer and specifically, a backend web developer with my current job into the domain of AI. I understand where I stand compared to most of the people and I can sincerely say that it is difficult for me to wade through so much noise online. And if it is difficult for someone like me, I can only imagine that for the rest of the populace.

#### This isn't the first global pandemic we're facing

If anything, humans are incredibly adept at overcoming events of such a scale. Pandemics have existed throughout the human history. The black plague, the spanish flu, the AIDS, or even the dancing plague (which you can read about to understand how psychogenic something like a pandemic could be). You can obviously read about them if you feel like, but what I'm more focused on what we should be more careful about is the overlaps of all the pandemic situations. We often oversee the effects that events like this have on us. Or at least that's what I wonder about. Of course, one other thing we're impeccable at is to eventually handle with what's left out. 


#### This isn't the first of the coronavirus strain we've encountered

I'm not a medical professional. And whoever is reading this, should atleast have the ability to search *coronavirus* on google or on Wikipedia and that'll immediately enlighten them about the two other major ones - SARS and MERS. I'll leave it upto you to read up on them if you so wish to. Just know that this isn't the first time we're encountering a strain of this virus. That is to say, if we're patient enough to read an article about a couple pages would give us a basic understanding of what the virus is. But of course, people don't - and that's the problem that I want to shine light on.  -->

And in the following pages, I hope I curate enough information for me, and anyone encountering these articles, to understand the pandemic situation from a layman's([2](covid-19.md#2-laymans-a-subjective-term)) perspective.
