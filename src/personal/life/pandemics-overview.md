# Chapter 4: Global Pandemics

As a software engineer I'm interestingly in a position to observe the world in a broader perspective because of my easy exposure to the world via the technological tools. 

I've been long wanting to write about it so as to get a better understanding of the state of things around the world on a different, typically overlooked, and trivial things that we often really oversee as a pandemic. That is to say, I don't view a pandemic as just a medical vulnerability but a *metaphysical* one. 

Unfortunately, the year of 2019-2020 not just brought into picture the metaphysical ones, but a literal medical pandemic. And that in turn forced me to take priority over the pandemic of the millenial generation - *The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19).*  Having said that, this doesn't mean I won't think through what I initially wanted to, but this takes precedence. Nobody could care about a metaphysical pandemic when there's one that literally makes you bleed and die. And now, that includes me too.


## Disclaimer ðŸš«
But before you go through the following pages in this chapter, understand my initial need to write about these things. It hurts for me to even write a disclaimer in the first place to be able to let people know *explicitly* that this is infinitely opinionated piece when it should be understood implicitly that something like this should inherently be considered as one. 

Oh how pathetic we are, to be stuck in a politically correct world of disclaimers and disclosures. (*Get it? That's one other pandemic of our times* but discussion on that for another day!)
