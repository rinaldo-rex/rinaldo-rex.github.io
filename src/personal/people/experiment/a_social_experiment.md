# Chapter 3: An experiment

*An experiment that I was doing throughout an year that I thought was important to me more than others.*

To those who don't know, here's the gist of what I've been doing throughout the year.

06 January, 2019 was when this started. I started posting to my social network handles, an image. A series of images, in fact, throughout the year.

*Cryptic, you could say.  
A self-devised puzzle, others would.  
A waste of time, some smirked.  
Crazy attempt at nothingness, few laughed.  
What's going on? Some squinted.  
He's onto something, but I'm not sure a few exclaimed.*  

The thing is, none of those are true. And all of them are true. At the same time.

If that either confused you, or made you think, that's the point of the experiment. Well, *one* of the **points** of the experiment.
This was more *psychological* than *sociological.*

And if you're still wondering at it all, please continue reading. Maybe the next couple of chapters will shed some light on this. No matter what you get out of this, remember, this is an *evolving* book.

I thank a lot of people for making this possible. You'll know who I thank the most as you read the chapters. But despite so many things, so many difficulties, a lot of you have stayed with me. And I am genuinely stoked to see people interested in this experiment of mine. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible. Thank you.
