## Journey of a thousand miles
<!-- > ####  -->

“Where are we going?” Riya asked.  

He smiled. Wearing the helmet and getting on the bike.  

“And don’t you dare tell me it’s all about the journey” she said, wearing her helmet as she sat on the bike. *But of course, you’re going to say that. Because it really is all about the journey. I know. But it’s easier to look at it all from a simpler perspective.*  

“Of course, it’s about the journey” he said. Riya shook her head, rolling her eyes and facepalming — all at once.  

“But it isn’t only about the journey. It’s about *who* I journey with” he smiled. 

“The thing is, people are either focused on the destiny or about the arduous path they have to take to reach the destiny. Neither is going to help us. Neither is supposed to help us, of course. It’s just that, we don’t realize what’s important. Or perhaps, what’s worthy. As humans, we always strive for meaning. Our job has to *mean* something. Our actions have to *mean* something. Our relationships, our friendships, our lifestyle… it all has to *mean* something — or that’s what we all, one way or the other, aim at: ***Meaning***. If it doesn’t mean anything, why do it? Why exist at all?”

“Ag — reed. But…” Riya knew she was stepping into one of his typical conversations — those that satisfy one’s thirst for discussions, but also exhausts their ability to think clearly. This isn’t going to be easy — contradicting of course, but also draining. *You owe me, darling.* She thought as she continued to ponder into his conversation, “But to most people, it really doesn't matter. Not everybody looks for meaning when they do something” She slowed down as she said those words. It was hard to put that into a binary answer of yes or no.

“Very true. And that’s where I was going” he slowed down his bike. It was now half past ten. It was getting colder. By the looks of it, they were entering a small village. He stopped at a small tea shop — ordering two. 
Riya didn’t ask anything. She was busy looking around. It’s been long since she saw huts instead of big blocks of concretes. 

“Stark difference isn’t?” He asked looking at her exclaim at all these. 

“It sure is. Been real long since I’ve been to my house at the country side. Feels so foreign now to look at these things”. She could hear the crickets chirping nearby. She even heard a ringing sound in her ears once Fred switched off the bike ignition. It was *that* quiet. 

“What’s the audible equivalent to pitch-black?” she asked hinting at how quiet the environment was. The hot tea was complementing the cold breeze. She smiled at him. They were quite for a while.
