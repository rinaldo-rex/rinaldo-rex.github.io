# Preface


If you're here for the first time, you'll probably be wondering at the structure of the site and it might throw you off a bit. You can read about it here. 


## Structure of the site

- ### Spills

    I write a lot of random things apart from my developer life, and that's what you'll find over here. Especially on random, unintellegible philosophical ideas. 🤷🏻‍♂️

- ### Code Crumples
        
    I'm a developer. I encounter a lot of interesting, and weird code patterns and styles of software development that I think more people should consider taking a look at. 
- ### README/Preface
        
    *Ping!* You're here. 🤪


And this site is subject to evolve, as does everything around us.
